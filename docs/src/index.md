# EnergyModelsCompliance

`EnergyModelsCompliance` is a utility message for the `EnergyModelsX` framework focusing on providing the user with functionality to check whether newly developed element descriptions are complying with the framework.
These functions are included for both [`EnergyModelsBase`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/stable/) and [`EnergyModelsGeography`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsGeography.jl/stable/)

It should be utilized for obtaining an overview of potential problems, but **not** as substitution for rigerous testing.
