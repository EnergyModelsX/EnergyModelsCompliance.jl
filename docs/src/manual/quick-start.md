# [Quick Start](@id man-quick)

> 1. Install the most recent version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
> 2. Install the package [`EnergyModelsBase`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/), the time package [`TimeStruct`](https://sintefore.github.io/TimeStruct.jl/), and [`EnergyModelsCompliance`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsCompliance.jl/) by running:
>
>    ```julia
>    ] add TimeStruct
>    ] add EnergyModelsBase
>    ] add EnergyModelsCompliance
>    ```

!!! note
    If you receive the error that EnergyModelsBase is not yet registered, you have to add the package using the GitHub repositories through `] add https://github.com/EnergyModelsX/EnergyModelsCompliance.jl` Once the package is registered, this is not required.
