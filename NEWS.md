# Release notes

## Version 0.1.0 (2025-03-xx)

Initial version of the package:

* Inclusion of compliance checks for new `Node`s and `Link`s
  * Checks highlight whether a `Node` or `Link` can work with existing functions or have a new method.
  * Checks mostly provide warnings, as errors are dependent on the chosen functions from `EnergyModelsBase`
