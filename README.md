`EnergyModelsCompliance` is an extension package within the `EnergyModelsX` (`EMX`) framework.
It provides the user with the functionality for identifying potential problems in newly developed elements for the `EMX` framework.
While it can be used as a first step for checking new elements, thorough tests of new elements are always recommended to test whether the developed elements fulfill the needs.

## Usage

The usage of the package is best illustrated through the commented [`examples`](examples).
The examples showcase how the functions from `EnergyModelsCompliance` can be utilized to identify whether your newly developed element can be incorporated in `EnergyModelsBase` or `EnergyModelsGeography` models.

> [!WARNING]
> The package is not yet registered.
> It is hence necessary to first clone the package and manually add the package to the example environment through:
>
> ```julia
> ] dev ..
